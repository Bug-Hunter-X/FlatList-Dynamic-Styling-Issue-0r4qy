# React Native FlatList Dynamic Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked bug in React Native's FlatList component: the failure to correctly apply dynamic styles within the `renderItem` function.

## Problem

When rendering items in a FlatList and attempting to apply styles based on the item's data, the styles might not be updated correctly, resulting in inconsistencies in appearance.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the style object is constructed and returned correctly within the renderItem function. The provided solution employs a separate function to generate the styles based on the item's properties.  This isolates style generation from other parts of the render logic. This avoids React's reconciliation issues of rendering the same component with the same state but different generated styles causing inconsistencies
